olofmeister	"Olof ""olofmeister"" Kajbjer Gustafsson (formerly known as olofm) (born January 31, 1992) is an inactive Swedish professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and former professional Counter-Strike player. His time in FaZe Clan, which began in August 2017 and conclusively ended in January 2022, comes after his legendary 3-year-long tenure with Fnatic, during which he won two Majors — ESL One: Katowice 2015 and ESL One: Cologne 2015 — and numerous other international tournaments, and was named the best player in the world of 2015. While playing for Fnatic, Olof had to take a medical leave in April 2016 due to a wrist injury. His return to the roster was announced in June, as Gustafsson was fit to play again.  His 3-year-long tenure with Fnatic lasted until August 2017, when he transferred to FaZe Clan.  In April 2018, he took a personal leave of absence and was inactive for a month.  Due to personal issues, he went inactive again in June and returned a month later.  After continuing to play for FaZe for nearly two years, olofmeister took a five-month-long break in 2020, returning to the roster again as a stand-in in October following Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač's departure to G2 Esports.  After FaZe's grand final run at BLAST Premier: Spring Groups 2021, Olof announced that he would be indefinitely stepping down from the organization's roster.  In June, as Marcelo ""coldzera"" David stepped down, Gustafsson was again reinstated to the active roster, this time as a more permanent member.  After the PGL Major in Stockholm, Robin ""ropz"" Kool was acquired by FaZe Clan in January 2022 as a replacement for the Swede, who once again took a step back from the active roster."

He is one of the most decorated players in North America, despite having only played CS:GO since the summer of 2014. On January 11, 2016, he joined Cloud9; although the announcement was met with criticism from both professionals and the public, Stewie2K soon became known as one of the best players in Cloud9. After 2 years on the roster and a Major title under his belt, he decided to move on and join Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo's leadership in SK Gaming–MIBR. Following months of up-and-down results, he returned to his North American roots and joined Team Liquid. In 2019, he won the second Intel Grand Slam, becoming the first North American player to win both a Major and an IGS trophy. He was an entry fragger and an in-game leader later in his career."
