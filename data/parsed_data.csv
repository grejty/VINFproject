While playing for Fnatic, Olof had to take a medical leave in April 2016 due to a wrist injury. His return to the roster was announced in June, as Gustafsson was fit to play again.  His 3-year-long tenure with Fnatic lasted until August 2017, when he transferred to FaZe Clan.  In April 2018, he took a personal leave of absence and was inactive for a month.  Due to personal issues, he went inactive again in June and returned a month later.  After continuing to play for FaZe for nearly two years, olofmeister took a five-month-long break in 2020, returning to the roster again as a stand-in in October following Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač's departure to G2 Esports.  After FaZe's grand final run at BLAST Premier: Spring Groups 2021, Olof announced that he would be indefinitely stepping down from the organization's roster.
